Play the Chaos Came using the corners of an equilateral triangle as the reference points. Add a starting point at random (preferably inside the triangle). Then add the next point halfway between the staring point and one of the reference points. This reference point is chosen at random.

After a sufficient number of iterations, the image of a Sierpinski Triangle should emerge.
